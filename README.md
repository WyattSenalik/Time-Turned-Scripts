These are the scripts that were used to create Time Turned, a multi-year game project that has been published on Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877110/Time_Turned/.

I (Wyatt Senalik) led the development team and wrote the majority of the code, among other things.

These are meant to be used as reference for assertaining if I (Wyatt Senalik) meet your desired competency in architecting and programming for a large, multi-year project.
The full Unity project has not been shared because that would allow for easy piracy. If you would like more information about where any of the scripts are used in the project or want to see parts of the Unity project, feel free to email me at wsenalik@hotmail.com

For a quick example of how I solved a complex problem (time travel game mechancis), see the following scripts:
